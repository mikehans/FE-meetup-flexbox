# Notes for Demo 1
* This is a basic demo showing layout of 3 flex item DIVs on an axis.
	* The red border shows where the start of the main axis is
* Shows converting between flex-directions
* Shows use of justify-content and align-items
* Shows use of align-self for modifying a subset of the flex items
	* align-self can be applied to a group at once (not just individual items) by applying a CSS class to multiple flex items
